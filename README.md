## Introduction

Vesti is an app for iOS devices that helps customers shop more sustainably. Often when we shop, it’s difficult to determine whether we’re making sustainable choices with the products we buy without extensive research beforehand. That’s where Vesti comes in. Users can take a photo of the product they are considering buying, upload images of a product’s barcode, and Vesti will provide a “green rating” (GR) out of 10 for both the product itself (based on its component materials) and the brand (based on their sustainability initiatives). If users wish, they may also click a button to view Vesti’s reasoning for the sustainability scores, allowing them to make more informed choices to shop in a more eco-friendly manner.
