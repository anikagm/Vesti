## Introduction

Vesti is an app for iOS devices that helps customers shop more sustainably. Often when we shop, it‚Äôs difficult to determine whether we‚Äôre making sustainable choices with the products we buy without extensive research beforehand. That‚Äôs where Vesti comes in. Users can take a photo of the product they are considering buying, upload images of a product‚Äôs barcode, and Vesti will provide a ‚Äúgreen rating‚Äù (GR) out of 10 for both the product itself (based on its component materials) and the brand (based on their sustainability initiatives). If users wish, they may also click a button to view Vesti‚Äôs reasoning for the sustainability scores, allowing them to make more informed choices to shop in a more eco-friendly manner.


## Features

- Barcode image upload: Users can upload an image of the barcode on the tag of the product they wish to purchase.
- Green rating: Vesti provides a sustainability score for both the product and the brand.
- Product/brand info: Vesti provides a more detailed summary of its reasonings


## File Descriptions

**allergen_info.py:**  It is in charge of giving the user a short description of the products that are being used in the product and, with that, it also identifies allergens and associated hazards the product has. Finally, all this data is printed. 

**brand_info.py:**  This code is designed to evaluate the product for sustainability and humanitarianism. After identifying these variables, alternative brands are suggested at a similar price point.  

**image_analysis.py:**  Processes the image that the user inputs, extracts the numbers from the barcode image and returns them in JSON format. 

**product_database.py:** Contains database of sample store inventory. Database contains products (e.g. shirts, pants, sunglasses, etc.) as individual entries, with each entry containing the brand name, product type, and list of component materials. Each entry also corresponds to a key, which is the product‚Äôs barcode number. Also contains functionality to search for specific barcode numbers based on the image the user uploads and returns all information stored in each entry.

**main.py:** The code is in charge of taking the barcode image, match it with a number in the database to identify which product they are talking about, retrieves all the details and information that were previously identified (allergens, sustainability, information about the product, etc) and shows it all to the user.

**product_info.py:** The code is in charge of getting information about a product, like the sustainability rating and description, based on a product's details.
